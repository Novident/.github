**Novident** is a groundbreaking **open-source writing suite** designed to be the ultimate free alternative to Scrivener, the world's leading writing software. Built with modularity and freedom in mind, Novident empowers authors, researchers, and storytellers with Scrivener-like features‚Äîwithout the cost or closed-source limitations.

## What is the motivation behind Novident existence ‚ùì

One of the biggest reasons this project was created is because there is no truly viable alternative to Scrivener, or at least one that offers a similar writing experience, without having to pay for advanced functionality. Most current platforms offer partial solutions, none of which can match Scrivener's **holistic environment** for long-form writing.

### Our Target

Novident bridges this gap by providing:

- **üÜì 100% Free & Open Source:** No paywalls, ever.
- **üß© Modular Architecture:** We use our own individual components (corkboard, compiler, tree view) to create each of your project's modules.
- **üîç Scrivener-Like Experience:** Intuitive UI/UX that tries to resemble Scrivener's core workflow as much as possible.
- **üåç Community-Driven:** Built by and for writers who value transparency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> **Novident** is not affiliated with Scrivener or Literature & Latte. Our goal is to create a free, ethical alternative inspired by their workflow innovations.
