**Novident** is an **open source writing suite** designed to be a free, cross-platform alternative that is as similar as possible to [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). Built with modularity and freedom in mind, Novident offers authors, researchers, and storytellers Scrivener-like features without the cost or limitations of closed source code.

## Motivation

**Scrivener** is one of the most beloved project-creation tools among novelists, students, and researchers. Yet, like any software, it has its limitations—poor cross-platform compatibility and a paid model that can be a barrier for many users. The most frustrating part? There’s no true **Scrivener** alternative that preserves its most valued features. Many users lose access to essential tools simply because they can’t afford the software.

**This reality drives our mission:** to create a 100% free and transparent solution that, while not matching Scrivener in full, delivers a comparable experience where it matters most.

We’re not aiming to surpass **Scrivener** in design or functionality. Our current focus is to deliver a viable, minimalist-yet-powerful alternative to one of the best writing tools available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> **Novident** is not affiliated with Scrivener or Literature & Latte. Our goal is to create a free, ethical alternative inspired by their workflow innovations.

### Our Target

Novident bridges this gap by providing:

- **🆓 100% Free & Open Source:** No paywalls, ever.
- **🧩 Modular Architecture:** We use our own individual components (corkboard, compiler, tree view, editor, and split view) to create each of your project's modules.
- **🔍 Comfortable Experience:** Intuitive UI/UX that tries to resemble Scrivener's core workflow as much as possible.
- **🌍 Community-Driven:** Built by and for writers who value transparency.

## Modular Architecture 🧱

Novident is built as a collection of independent, reusable libraries:

```
── novident-editor/      # Custom editor component
── novident-corkboard/   # Corkboard UI
── novident-compiler/    # Export engine
── novident-tree-view/   # Hierarchical project view
── novident-split-view/  # General grid-based view separator 
```
