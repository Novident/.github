> [!WARNING]
> **This project is still in its early stages of development, so a lot could change from version to version**

**Novident** is an innovative **open source writing suite** designed to be a free, cross-platform alternative that is as similar as possible to [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). Built with modularity and freedom in mind, Novident offers authors, researchers, and storytellers Scrivener-like features without the cost or limitations of closed source code.

## Motivation

One of the main reasons this project was created is that (currently) there is no alternative that can match Scrivener, or at least one that offers a similar writing experience without having to pay for advanced features and that is cross-platform. As many know, Scrivener is mostly only available for iOS or macOS, although it also has support for Windows.

This is why we decided that creating Novident would be a good solution to most of the problems we have when looking for a similar alternative that is available on any current platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> **Novident** is not affiliated with Scrivener or Literature & Latte. Our goal is to create a free, ethical alternative inspired by their workflow innovations.

### Our Target

Novident bridges this gap by providing:

- **🆓 100% Free & Open Source:** No paywalls, ever.
- **🧩 Modular Architecture:** We use our own individual components (corkboard, compiler, tree view) to create each of your project's modules.
- **🔍 Scrivener-Like Experience:** Intuitive UI/UX that tries to resemble Scrivener's core workflow as much as possible.
- **🌍 Community-Driven:** Built by and for writers who value transparency.
